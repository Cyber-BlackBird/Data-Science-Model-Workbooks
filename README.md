# Data-Science-Model-Workbooks

In this Repository I highlight my learning path with various solvable workbooks which feature rather simple Data Sets. 
The workbooks I have solved are -
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* K Nearest Neighbours
* Decision Tree and Random Forests
* Support Vector Machines
* Natural Langauge Processing
